The Hadean Eon began 4.6 billion years ago, when the Earth first condensed out of the accretion disc of rocky material orbiting our newborn star, the Sun. Our planet’s mantle, runnier than it is today and laden with hot, short-lived radioactive elements, roiled queasily, outgassing carbon dioxide and water vapor. The surface was a volcanic hellscape, glowing with lakes of superheated lava and pocked with sulfurous vents belching smoke.<p>It took hundreds of millions of years for surface conditions to settle down. According to the International Astronomical Union, an object orbiting a star can only be considered a planet if it has enough mass to either absorb or, in sweeping by, to eject other occupants from its orbit. But in the chaos of the early Solar system, this took a long time. While Earth was clearing its orbit of debris, it was continually bombarded by comets and asteroids, including giant impactors more than 60 miles across. A single such impact would have heated the already stifling atmosphere to a thousand degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>One of those collisions appears to have been with another newly formed planet, an event that came close to destroying the Earth altogether. According to this theory, enough broken, liquefied, and vaporized rock splashed into orbit to coalesce into the Moon.</p></div><div class="figure image undefined" id="volcanovideo-fig"><figure class="" id="volcanovideo-img"><img src="/assets/images/chapter-01/Halema_uma_u_Crater_in_Kilauea_volcano,_Hawaii.-Enhanced-SR.webp" alt="" title="" id="Halema_uma_u_Crater_in_Kilauea_volcano,_Hawaii.-Enhanced-SR.webp"><figcaption>Lava lake, Kīlauea, Hawai‘i</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text-img volcanovideo-text"></div></div><p></p><div class="img-wrapper figarea" id="zircon"><div class="text-img zircon-text">Unsurprisingly, very little geological material survives from the Hadean—mainly zircon crystals embedded within metamorphic sandstone in the Jack Hills of Western Australia.<p>It’s difficult to imagine anything like life forming or surviving under such harsh conditions.

These form around hydrothermal vents on the mid-ocean ridges where tectonic plates are pulling apart and new crust is forming. In such places, seawater seeping down into the rock comes into contact with hot magma. Superheated water then boils back up, carrying hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and sulfur compounds, which precipitate out to build smoking undersea chimneys. Probes sent thousands of feet down to explore these otherworldly environments find them teeming with weird life forms of all kinds, attracted by warmth, nutrients, and each other. Some of the inhabitants may go a long, long way back.</p><p>Like lava rock, the chimneys are porous, and the pores are ideal little chambers for contained chemical reactions to take place—potentially powered by a handy energy source, since the hydrogen gas creates proton gradients across the thin walls between pores, making them act like batteries.<span id="ft-4" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">4</sup> </span>Given energy, iron sulfide minerals in the rock to act as catalysts, and carbon dioxide bubbling through, self-perpetuating loops of chemical reactions can sputter to life, like a motor turning over.</p><div class="xfade-wrapper figarea" id="krebs-reversekrebs"><div class="text-img text-crossfade krebs-reversekrebs-text">Perhaps this was life’s original motor: a primitive but quasi-stable metabolism, as yet without genes, enzymes, or even a clearly defined boundary between inside and outside. Such upgrades might have followed before long, though, for that chemical synthesis motor closely resembles the “reverse Krebs cycle,” now widely believed to have powered the earliest cells.<p>The ordinary or “forward” Krebs cycle was discovered in 1937 by groundbreaking biochemist Hans Krebs (1900–1981). More like a gas-powered generator than a motor, the Krebs cycle is at the heart of how all aerobic organisms on Earth “burn” organic fuels to release energy, a process known as “respiration.”<span id="ft-5" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">5</sup> </span>Inputs to this cycle of chemical reactions include complex organic molecules (which we eat) and oxygen (which we inhale); the “exhaust” contains carbon dioxide and water (which we exhale).

In an almost literal sense, our bodies are like Russian matryoshka dolls, membranes within membranes, and each nested environment recreates an earlier stage in the evolution of life on Earth.<p>The deeper inside ourselves we look, the farther we can see into the past.

Roughly two billion years ago, the bacteria that became our mitochondria were engulfed by another single-celled life form[^11] much like today’s archaea—tiny, equally ancient microorganisms that continue to inhabit extreme environments, like hot springs and deep-sea vents. This is “symbiogenesis,” the creation or genesis of a new kind of entity out of a novel “symbiosis,” or mutually beneficial relationship, among pre-existing entities.<p>At moments like these, the tree of life doesn’t just branch; it also entangles with itself, its branches merging to produce radically new forms. Margulis was an early champion of the idea that these events drive evolution’s leaps forward.</p></div><div class="figure image undefined" id="mitochondriavideo-fig"><figure class="" id="mitochondriavideo-img"><img src="/assets/images//undefined" alt="" title="" id="undefined"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text-img mitochondriavideo-text"></div></div><p></p><p>It’s likely that bacteria are themselves the product of such symbiotic events—for instance, between RNA and metabolism.<span id="ft-10" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">10</sup> </span>RNA <em>could</em> replicate without help from proteins, and the metabolic motor <em>could</em> proliferate without help from genes, but when these systems cooperate, they do better. The looping chemical reaction networks in those black smokers can be understood as such an alliance in their own right, a set of reactions which, by virtue of catalyzing each other, can form a more robust, self-sustaining whole.</p><p>So in a sense, Darwin may have been right to say that “it is mere rubbish” to think about the origin of life, for life may have <em>had</em> no single origin, but rather, have woven itself together from many separate strands, the oldest of which look like ordinary chemistry. Intelligent design is not required for that weaving to take place; only the incontrovertible logic that sometimes an alliance creates something enduring, and that whatever is enduring … endures.</p><p>Often, <em>enduring</em> means both creating and occupying entirely new niches. Hence eukaryotes did not replace bacteria; indeed, they ultimately created many new niches for them. Likewise, the symbiotic emergence of multicellular life—another major evolutionary transition—did not supplant single-celled life. Like an ancient parchment overwritten by generations of scribes, our planet is a palimpsest, its many-layered past still discernible in the present. Even the black smokers, throwbacks to a Hadean sea billions of years ago, are still bubbling away in the depths. The self-catalyzing chemistry of proto-life may still be brewing down there, slowly, on the ocean floor.</p><p>The idea that evolution is driven by symbiotic mergers, the earliest of which preceded biology as we know it, has far-reaching implications. One is that the boundary between life and non-life is not well defined; symbiogenesis can involve any process that, one way or another, is self-perpetuating. Evolutionary dynamics are thus more like a physical law than a biological principle. <em>Everything</em> can be subject to evolution, whether we consider it to be “alive” or not.</p><p>The symbiogenetic view also renders the idea of distinct species, classified according to a Linnaean taxonomy, somewhat ill-defined—or at best, of limited applicability. Such taxonomies assume that only branching takes place, not merging. Bacteria, which promiscuously transfer genes even between “species,” already challenge this idea.<span id="ft-11" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">11</sup> </span>Taxonomies break down entirely when we try to apply them to even more fluid situations, like the possible proto-life in black smokers, or microbiomes, or the more complex symbioses we’ll explore later.</p><div class="img-wrapper figarea" id="finchesvideo"><div class="text-img finchesvideo-text">Perhaps most importantly, symbiogenesis explains evolution’s arrow of time, as classical Darwinian theory alone cannot. When life branches, specializing to adapt to a niche—like Darwin’s finches with their differently shaped beaks, each optimized for a specific food source—those branches are in general no more complex than their ancestral form. This has led some classical evolutionary theorists to argue that the increasing complexity of life on Earth is an anthropocentric illusion, nothing more than the result of a random meander through genetic possibilities.[^14] Relatedly, one sometimes hears the claim that since all extant species are of equal age—as it seems they must be, since all share a common single-celled ancestor some four billion years ago—no species is more “evolved” than any other.<p>On its face, that seems reasonable. But as we’ve seen, classical Darwinian theory struggles to explain why life seems to become increasingly complex, or indeed, how life could arise in the first place. In themselves, random changes or mutations can only fine-tune, diversify, and optimize, allowing the expression of one or another variation already latent in the genetic space. (The space of possible finch beaks, for instance.)</p></div><div class="figure image undefined" id="finchesvideo-fig"><figure class="" id="finchesvideo-img"><img src="/assets/images//undefined" alt="" title="" id="undefined"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text-img finchesvideo-text"></div></div><p></p><p>When one prokaryote ends up living inside another, though, or multiple cells band together to make a multicellular life form, the resulting composite organism is clearly more complex than its parts. Something genuinely new has arisen. The branching and fine-tuning of classical evolution can now start to operate on a whole different level, over a new space of combinatorial possibilities.</p><p>Classical evolution isn’t <em>wrong</em>; it just misses half of the story—the more rapid, more creative half. One could say that evolution’s other half is <em>re</em>volution, and that revolutions occur through symbiosis.</p><div class="img-wrapper figarea" id="haftedspear"><div class="text-img haftedspear-text">Suggestively, the same is true of technology. In Paleolithic times, a hafted spear was not just a specialized stone point, but something new that arose by combining at least three parts: a stone point, a shaft, and something like sinew to bind them. This, too, opened up a new combinatorial design space. Or, in more recent times, the silicon chip was not just an evolved transistor; it was something new that could be made by putting multiple transistors together on the same die. One doesn’t arrive at chip design merely by playing with the design parameters of an individual transistor.<p>That’s why evolution progresses from simpler to more complex forms. It’s also why the simpler forms often remain in play even after a successful symbiogenetic event. Standalone stone points, like knives and hand axes, were still being made after the invention of the hafted spear; and, of course, spearheads themselves still count as stone points.<span id="ft-12" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">12</sup> </span>Moreover, no matter how recently any particular stone point was made, we can meaningfully talk about stone points being “older” as a category than spears.

He suggested a notation for writing down the table of rules, which he referred to as a machine’s “Standard Description” or “S.D.” Today, we’d call it a “program.”</p><p>Then, the really clever part: if the <em>program itself</em> is written on the tape, there exist particular tables of rules that will read the program and perform whatever computation it specifies. Today, these are called “Universal Turing Machines.” In Turing’s more precise language, “It is possible to invent a single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence.

But a complex machine—one with any internal parts, for example—can’t serve as its own template. And if you <em>are</em> a complex machine, then, on the face of it, manufacturing something just as complex as you yourself are has a whiff of paradox, like lifting yourself up by your own bootstraps. However, von Neumann showed that it is not only possible, but straightforward, using a generalization of the Universal Turing Machine.</p><p>He envisioned a “machine A” that would read a tape containing sequential assembly instructions based on a limited catalog of parts, and carry them out, step by step. Then, there would be a “machine B” whose function was to copy the tape—assuming the tape itself was also made of available parts. If instructions for building machines A and B are <em>themselves</em> encoded on the tape, then <em>voilà</em>—you would have a replicator.<span id="ft-15" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">15</sup></span></p><p>Instructions for building any additional non-reproductive machinery could also be encoded on the tape, so it would even be possible for a replicator to build something <em>more</em> complex than itself.<span id="ft-16" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">16</sup> </span>A seed, or a fertilized egg, illustrates the point. Even more fundamentally, encoding the instructions to build oneself in a form that is itself replicated (the tape) is the key to open-ended evolvability, meaning the ability for evolution to select for an arbitrary design change, and for that change to be inherited by the next generation.</p><p>Remarkably, von Neumann described these requirements for an evolvable, self-replicating machine before the discovery of DNA’s structure and function.<span id="ft-17" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">17</sup> </span>Nonetheless, he got it exactly right. For life on Earth, DNA is the tape; DNA polymerase, which copies DNA, is “machine B”; and ribosomes, which build proteins by following the sequentially encoded instructions on DNA, are “machine A.” Ribosomes and DNA polymerase are made of proteins whose sequences are, in turn, encoded in our DNA and manufactured by ribosomes.

Only a statistical asymmetry favors one direction over another, with clever origami moves tending to “lock in” certain steps such that a next step becomes likely to happen.

The first computers needed to carry out long calculations using as few parts as possible. Originally, those parts were flaky, expensive vacuum tubes, which had a tendency to burn out and needed frequent replacement by hand. The natural design, then, was a minimal “Central Processing Unit” (CPU) operating on sequences of bits ferried back and forth from an external memory.

With characteristic bravura, von Neumann went so far as to design, on paper, the key components of a *self-reproducing* cellular automaton, including a horizontal line of cells comprising a “tape” and blocks of cellular “circuitry” implementing machines A and B.<p>Designing a cellular automaton is far harder than ordinary programming, because every cell or “pixel” is simultaneously altering its own state and its environment.

I’m afraid he called this language … Brainfuck. Please direct all naming feedback his way.</p><p>However, the shoe fits; it <em>is</em> a beast to program in. Here, for instance, is a Brainfuck program that prints “helloworld”—and good luck making any sense of it:</p><p>++++++[−&gt;+++++&lt;]&gt;−[&gt;[++++&gt;]++++[&lt;]&gt;−]&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.&gt;+.&lt;&lt;…&lt;−.&lt;+++.&gt;.+++.&gt;.&gt;&gt;−.</p><p>The upside of Brainfuck is its utter minimalism. It’s not quite a single-instruction language, like SUBLEQ, but as you can see, it includes only a handful of operations. Like a Turing Machine, it specifies a read/write head that can step left (the “&lt;” instruction) or right (the “&gt;” instruction) along a tape. The “+” and “−” instructions increment and decrement the byte at the current position on the tape.<span id="ft-19" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">19</sup> </span>The “,” and “.” instructions input a byte from the console, or output a byte to it (you can count ten “.” instructions in the code above, one to print each letter of “helloworld”). Finally, the “[” and “]” instructions implement looping: “[” will skip forward to its matching “]” if the byte at the current position is zero, and “]” will jump back to its matching “[” if the byte is <em>non</em>zero. That’s it!</p><p>It’s hard to believe that Brainfuck could be used to fully implement, say, the Windows operating system, but—it <em>is</em> “Turing complete.” Here that means: given enough time and memory (that is, a long enough tape), it can emulate any other computer and compute anything that <em>can</em> be computed.</p><p>In our version, which we call bff, there’s a “soup” containing thousands of tapes, each of which includes both code <em>and</em> data. This is key: in “classic” Brainfuck, the code is separate from the tape, whereas in bff, we wanted the code to be able to modify itself. That can only happen if the code itself is on the tape, as Turing originally envisioned.</p><p>Bff tapes are of fixed length—64 bytes, just one byte longer than the cryptic “helloworld” program above. They start off filled with random bytes. Then, they interact at random, over and over. In an interaction, two randomly selected tapes are stuck end to end, and this combined 128 byte–long tape is run, potentially modifying itself. The 64 byte–long halves are then pulled back apart and dropped back into the soup. Once in a while, a byte value is randomized, as cosmic rays do to DNA.</p><p>Since bff has only 7 instructions (represented by the characters “&lt;&gt;+−,[]”) and there are 256 possible byte values, following random initialization only 7/256, or 2.7%, of the bytes in a given tape will contain valid instructions; any non-instructions are simply skipped over.<span id="ft-20" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">20</sup> </span>Thus, at first, not much comes of interactions between tapes. Once in a while, a valid instruction will modify a byte, and this modification will persist in the soup. On average, though, only a couple of computational operations take place per interaction, and usually, they have no effect. In other words, while any kind of computation is theoretically <em>possible</em> in this toy universe, precious little of it actually takes place—at first. Random mutation may alter a byte here and there. Even when a valid instruction causes a byte to change, though, the alteration is arbitrary and purposeless.</p><div class="img-wrapper figarea" id="bffvideo"><div class="text-img bffvideo-text">But after millions of interactions, something magical happens: the tapes begin to reproduce\! As they spawn copies of themselves and each other, randomness quickly gives way to complex order. The amount of computation taking place in each interaction skyrockets, since—remember—reproduction requires computation. Two of Brainfuck’s seven instructions (“\[” and “\]”) are dedicated to conditional branching, and define loops in the code; reproduction requires at least one such loop (“copy bytes until done”), causing the number of instructions executed in an interaction to climb into the thousands.</div><div class="figure image undefined" id="bffvideo-fig"><figure class="" id="bffvideo-img"><img src="/assets/images//undefined" alt="" title="" id="undefined"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text-img bffvideo-text"></div></div><div class="xfade-wrapper figarea" id="phasetransition-continuedrise"><div class="text-img text-crossfade phasetransition-continuedrise-text">The code is no longer random, but obviously *purposive*, in the sense that its function can be analyzed and reverse-engineered.

But if we were to begin with sand on a beach subject to random wave action, and came back after a few hours to find a poem written there, or the sand grains fused into a complex electronic circuit, we would assume someone was messing with us.</p><p>The extreme improbability of complex order arising spontaneously is generally understood to follow from thermodynamics, the branch of physics concerned with the statistical behavior of matter subject to random thermal fluctuations—that is, of all matter, since above absolute zero, <em>everything</em> is subject to such randomness. Matter subject to random forces is supposed to become more random, not less. Yet by growing, reproducing, evolving, and indeed by existing at all, life seems to violate this principle.</p><p>The violation is only apparent, for life requires an input of free energy, allowing the forces of entropy to be kept at bay. Still, the seemingly spontaneous emergence and “complexification” of living systems has appeared to be, if not strictly disallowed by physical laws, at least unexplained by them. That’s why the great physicist Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961) wrote, in an influential little book he published in 1944 entitled <em>What Is Life?</em>,<span id="ft-21" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">21</sup></span></p><p>“[L]iving matter, while not eluding the ‘laws of physics’ as established up to date, is likely to involve ‘other laws of physics’ hitherto unknown, which, however, once they have been revealed, will form just as integral a part of this science as the former.”</p><p></p></div><p></p><div id="thermodynamics" class="chapter"><div class="chapter-opener"><h2>Thermodynamics</h2><p><strong>Before turning to those “other laws of physics,” it’s helpful to take a closer look at the original ones, and especially the Second Law of thermodynamics.</strong></p><p>These are deep waters.

Nonetheless, Boltzmann’s conceptually challenging ideas flummoxed many of his fellow scientists, and their implications continue to stir controversy even today. Much has been made of Einstein turning our everyday notions of space and time inside-out with his theory of relativity, developed in its initial form in 1905—just a year before Boltzmann, struggling with bipolar disorder, ended his own life. Arguably, though, Boltzmann’s earlier ideas disrupt our intuitions about time, cause, and effect even more radically than Einstein’s theory of relativity.<span id="ft-22" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">22</sup> </span>Let’s dive in.</p></div><p></p><p>The Second Law of thermodynamics holds that any closed system will rise in entropy over time, becoming increasingly disordered.

Imagine video footage of balls on a billiard table, all in random positions and moving in random directions.

If we (unrealistically) assume frictionless motion and fully elastic collisions (i.e., balls don’t slow down as they roll, and none of the collision energy is dissipated as heat), this would go on forever. The summed momenta and summed energies of the balls will remain constant—and it will be impossible to tell whether you’re watching the video forward or in reverse. In such a universe, causality has no meaning, because nothing distinguishes causes from effects.<p>If the initial conditions were random, then the positions of the balls will continue to be randomly distributed over the table’s surface as they all bounce around, transferring some of their energy to each other with every collision. It would be astronomically unlikely for the balls to all bunch up in one spot. Their velocities, too, will be randomly distributed, both in direction and magnitude, so it would also be astronomically unlikely for them to, for instance, suddenly all be moving precisely parallel to the table’s edges.

It was based on a heating-and-cooling cycle. First, steam from a boiler was allowed to flow into a cylindrical chamber, raising a piston; then, the steam valve closed, and a second valve opened, injecting a jet of cold water, causing the steam to condense and pull the piston back down. As the piston rose and fell, it rocked a giant beam back and forth, which, in Newcomen’s original design, was used to pump water out of flooded mines (which, in turn, supplied the coal these engines would soon be consuming so voraciously).<p>Scottish inventor and entrepreneur James Watt (1736–1819) greatly improved the steam engine design in 1776, making it a practical replacement for human and animal power across a wide range of applications. This was when the Industrial Revolution really got underway; for the first time, human-made machines began to <em>metabolize</em> on a large scale, “eating” complex organic molecules to perform mechanical work.</p><p>Soon, far more energy would be flowing through this artificial metabolism than through the Krebs cycle in our own bodies.<span id="ft-26" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">26</sup> </span>It was, in the broad sense I’ve been using in this book, a major evolutionary transition: a symbiogenetic event between humans and machines, like earlier symbioses between humans and draft animals.

What <em>was</em> heat, and how could it be converted into physical work? For a time, the leading theory held that heat was a kind of invisible, weightless fluid, “caloric,” that could flow spookily into and through other matter.</p><div class="img-wrapper figarea" id="piston"><div class="text-img piston-text">By combining Newtonian physics, statistical calculations, and experimental tests, Boltzmann and his colleagues figured out what was really going on. Their conceptual setup was a three-dimensional version of the billiard table, in which the balls were gas molecules whizzing around in a pressurized chamber, bouncing off its walls. Calculating the average effect of all the bouncing led to the Ideal Gas Law, which established theoretical relationships between the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas.

There was no need for any mysterious “caloric” fluid; heat was just motion on a microscopic scale.

We know that balls bouncing around a billiard table don’t <em>actually</em> go on bouncing forever. They encounter friction, slowing down as they roll. And when they bounce off each other, the collisions are slightly “inelastic,” meaning that after the collision, they’re moving a bit slower than before. After a little while, they stop rolling.</p><p>How can that be? At a microscopic level, the laws of physics are reversible. Momentum is supposed to be conserved. And the amount of matter and energy also remains constant, whether we run time forward or in reverse. That’s the <em>First</em> Law of thermodynamics!</p><p>Zooming in will reveal that, on a real billiard table, balls aren’t the smallest elements that bump against one other. Each billiard ball consists of lots of vibrating molecules bound together, and collisions between these individual molecules are what really cause the balls to bounce off each other—or, for that matter, cause a ball to roll across the felt rather than falling right through it.<span id="ft-29" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">29</sup> </span>In each case, momentum is transferred between molecules. Every time this happens, the distribution of molecular momenta becomes a bit more random, that is, a bit less correlated with which ball the molecule happens to be in, or indeed whether it is in a ball at all, or in the felt underneath.</p><p>In the most random distribution of molecular velocities, there would be no more correlation between the velocities of two molecules in one ball than in the velocities of molecules in different balls. Every ball would be imperceptibly jiggling in place, with each of its constituent molecules contributing minutely to the dance. We call that random jiggling “heat.” When all correlated motion has been converted into uniformly distributed heat, we’ve reached a stable equilibrium.</p><p>While the balls are still rolling, the correlations between the velocities of their molecules are by no means all equal; the distribution is far from random. This is <em>not</em> a stable equilibrium. Hence, the inevitability of friction and the inelasticity of collisions are statistical phenomena—just more symptoms of the inexorable Second Law.</p><p>Going forward, then, we can zoom back out and imagine once more that the billiard balls are indivisible particles, not bound collections of molecules. In that case, all collisions would have to be elastic, all motion frictionless, and disordered, randomly colliding balls would be the equilibrium.</p><p>Once a system has reached equilibrium, it will stay that way forever—an end state Lord Kelvin called “heat death.”<span id="ft-30" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">30</sup> </span>This seemingly trivial observation has some profound consequences. One is that the arrow of time will lose its meaning; any two consecutive moments <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> could just as likely have been ordered <em>B</em>, <em>A</em>. Nothing, therefore, can be said to be a cause, versus an effect.</p><p>Relatedly, no <em>work</em> can be done. If the system were out of equilibrium—for instance, if all of the whizzing balls were on one side of the billiard table—then we could put a movable barrier down between the empty and occupied sides, attached to a loaded crankshaft. As they bounce around, the balls would then nudge the barrier, doing work. What I’ve just described is, of course, a piston, like that of a steam engine.</p><p>But if the balls were equally likely to be anywhere, then no matter how fast they whizz and bounce, there’s nowhere to put the barrier that would result in any net force. The piston wouldn’t move because it would be buffeted equally from all sides. This idea can be generalized: work can only be done by a system in disequilibrium, for instance, when the pressure or temperature is high in one place, and low in another. That’s why Newcomen’s engine needed both hot steam <em>and</em> cold water.</p><p>I’ve already used the term <em>free energy</em>, but now we can define it. The free energy of a system is the amount of work it can be made to do. Far from equilibrium, when the entropy is low, much of the kinetic energy in the billiard balls is “free”; it can be used to move pistons, raise weights, produce electric currents, carry out computations, or drive metabolic processes. But at equilibrium, the entropy is maximized, and the free energy is zero. This insight into the relationship between energy, entropy, and work lies at the heart of thermodynamics—and life.</p><p></p></div><p></p><div id="dynamic-stability" class="chapter"><div class="chapter-opener"><h2>Dynamic stability</h2><p><strong>Recall that life seemed deeply weird to Schrödinger because living things appear to violate the Second Law.</strong></p><p>If the bacterium we drop into a beaker of water is alive rather than dead, and free energy is available in a form the bacterium can use, and the water contains simple molecules suitable for building more bacteria, then over time we will see the very opposite of an increase in disorder. After a while, the beaker will be <em>full</em> of bacteria, reproducing, cooperating, and competing with each other.</p><p></p></div><p></p><p>They will even be evolving. If the beaker is sufficiently large—the size of a planet, for instance—and we wait a few billion years, then eventually beings as complicated as us may be in there, along with cities, advanced technologies, and perhaps plans to colonize the next beaker.</p><p>None of these processes can occur without free energy. For us, it comes, ultimately, from the sun. Thermodynamics tells us that even if the Second Law appears to be violated locally, it still holds when we zoom out. Order created in one place comes at the expense of increased disorder elsewhere. Hence, pollution, the finite lifetime of the sun, and the eventual heat death of the universe.</p><p>What concerns us here isn’t this big picture, but its apparent local violations, and the way they seem to become increasingly transgressive over time. The puzzle isn’t only that bacteria exist, but that the more time passes, the more complex life on Earth seems to become: from prokaryotes to eukaryotes; from eukaryotes to multicellular animals; from simple multicellular animals to ones with nervous systems; from brainy animals to complex societies; from horses and plows to space travel and AI.</p><p>Is there any general principle behind that complexification process, a kind of “however” or “yes, and” to the dismal Second Law? And could it account not only for evolution and complexification, but also for abiogenesis?</p><p>Yes, and yes. Bff can offer us a highly simplified model system for understanding that principle, just as an idealized billiard table gives us a model for understanding basic thermodynamics.</p><p>Replicators arise in bff because an entity that reproduces is more “dynamically stable” than one that doesn’t. In other words, if we start with one tape that <em>can</em> reproduce and one that <em>can’t</em>, then at some later time we’re likely to find many copies of the one that can reproduce, but we’re unlikely to find the other at all, because it will have been degraded by noise or overwritten.</p><p>Addy Pross, a professor emeritus of chemistry at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, describes the same phenomenon using the bulkier phrase “dynamic kinetic stability” (DKS).<span id="ft-31" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">31</sup> </span>I’ll drop “kinetic,” since the idea also applies beyond Pross’s field of “chemical kinetics” (describing the rates at which chemical reactions take place). In bff, for example, dynamic stability can just as well apply to programs or program fragments.</p><p>As Pross points out, a population of molecules capable of replicating can be more stable than even the hardiest of passive materials. A passive object may be fragile, like a soap bubble, or robust, like a stone sculpture. The sculpture might endure for longer, but, in the end, it’s still ephemeral. Every encounter it has with anything else in the world will cause its composition or structure to degrade, its individual identity to blur. For a sculpture, it’s all downhill. That’s the Second Law at work, as usual.</p><p>A self-reproducing molecule—like the DNA inside a living bacterium—is another matter. It is thermodynamically fragile, especially if we consider its identity to consist not only of a general structure but of a long sequence of specific nucleotides. However, its <em>pattern</em> is not just robust, but “antifragile.”<span id="ft-32" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">32</sup> </span>As long as DNA is able to reproduce—an inherently dynamic process—that pattern can last, essentially, forever. A bit of environmental stress or adversity can even help DNA maintain or improve its functionality. This is how order overcomes disorder.</p><p>In fact, Darwinian selection is <em>equivalent</em> to the Second Law, once we expand our notion of stability to include populations of replicators. Through a thermodynamic lens, Darwin’s central observation was that a more effective replicator is more stable than a less effective one. As Pross puts it,</p><p>“[M]atter […] tends to become transformed […] from less stable to more stable forms. […] [T]hat is what chemical kinetics and thermodynamics is all about […]. And what is the central law that governs such transformations? The Second Law. […] In both [the static and kinetic] worlds chemical systems tend to become transformed into more stable ones […]—thermodynamic stability in the ‘regular’ chemical world, dynamic kinetic stability in the replicator world.”<span id="ft-33" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">33</sup></span></p><p>As a chemist, Pross is sensitive to the close relationships between energy, entropy, and stability, whether static or dynamic. However, he does not explicitly make a connection to the theory of computing.</p><p>It now seems clear that by unifying thermodynamics with the theory of computation, we should be able to understand life as the predictable outcome of a statistical process, rather than regarding it uneasily as technically permitted, yet mysterious. Our artificial life experiments demonstrate that, when computation is possible, it will be a “dynamical attractor,” since replicating entities are more dynamically stable than non-replicating ones; and, as von Neumann showed, replicators are inherently computational.</p><p>Bff has no concept of energy, but in our universe, replicators require an energy source. This is because, in general, computation involves irreversible steps—otherwise known as causes and effects—and thus, computing consumes free energy. That’s why the chips in our computers draw power and generate heat when they run. (And why my computer heats up when it runs bff.) Life must draw power and generate heat for the same reason: it is inherently computational.</p><p></p></div><p></p><div id="complexification" class="chapter"><div class="chapter-opener"><h2>Complexification</h2><p><strong>When we pick a tape out of the bff soup after millions of interactions, once replicators have taken over, we often see a level of complexity in the program on that tape that seems unnecessarily—even implausibly—high.</strong></p><p>A working replicator <em>could</em> consist of just a handful of instructions in a single loop, requiring a couple of hundred operations to run. Instead, we often see instructions filling up a majority of the 64 bytes, multiple and complex nested loops, and thousands of operations per interaction.</p></div><p></p><p>Where did all this complexity come from? It certainly doesn’t look like the result of simple Darwinian selection operating on the random text generated by a proverbial million monkeys typing on a million typewriters.<span id="ft-34" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">34</sup> </span>In fact, such complexity emerges even with <em>zero</em> random mutation—that is, given only the initial randomness in the soup, which works out to fewer bytes than the text of this short book. Hardly a million monkeys—and far too few random bytes to contain more than a few consecutive instructions, let alone a whole working program.</p><p>The answer recalls Lynn Margulis’s great insight: the central role of symbiosis in evolution, rather than random mutation and selection. When we look carefully at the quiescent period before tapes begin replicating, we notice a steady rise in the amount of computation taking place. We are observing the rapid emergence of <em>imperfect</em> replicators—very short bits of code that, in one way or another, have some nonzero probability of generating more code. Even if the code produced is not like the original, it’s still code, and <em>only</em> code can produce more code; non-code can’t produce anything!</p><p>Thus, a selection process is at work from the very beginning, wherein code begets code. This inherently creative, self-catalyzing process is far more important than random mutation in generating novelty. When bits of proliferating code combine to form a replicator, it’s a symbiotic event: by working together, these bits of code generate more code than they could separately, and the code <em>they</em> generate will in turn produce <em>more</em> code that does the same, eventually leading to whole-tape replication and an exponential takeoff.</p><div class="img-wrapper figarea" id="catscradlevideo"><div class="text-img catscradlevideo-text">A closer look at the bff soup prior to the exponential takeoff reveals distinct phases of “pre-life,” which might have had close analogs during abiogenesis on Earth. In the first phase, individual instructions occasionally generate another individual instruction, but this is more akin to a simple chemical reaction than to any real computation; the instructions are not acting as part of any larger program.<p>In the second phase, we begin to see instructions in particular positions, or in particular combinations, that are likelier to lead to copies of themselves than one would expect by random chance, albeit often in indirect ways. “Autocatalytic sets” start to form: cycles of dynamical interactions that mutually reinforce each other. These, too, can arise spontaneously in the chemical world, and have long been theorized to have driven abiogenesis.<span id="ft-35" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">35</sup></span></p><p>At this point, with autocatalytic fragments of code proliferating and colliding, a leap becomes possible that brings us beyond the world of digital chemistry and into the world of real computation: the emergence of the first true replicators. These are no longer mere autocatalytic sets, but short programs that copy themselves, or each other, using looped instructions.</p><p>With this leap to computation comes an enormous upgrade in evolvability, because now, any change made to a program that doesn’t break its copy loop will be heritable. Thus, classical Darwinian selection can kick in, allowing adaptation to a changing environment or speciation for occupying diverse niches. If we insist on making a distinction between non-life and life, this might be a reasonable place to draw that line.</p><p>However, these earliest replicating programs are unlikely to cleanly copy a whole tape. Often, they only copy short stretches of tape, which may get pasted into arbitrary locations, yielding unpredictable results. As these scrappy, fragmentary replicators proliferate, the bff soup enters a chaotic phase. Despite the churn, the tapes have not, at this point, resolved into any obvious structure. To the naked eye, they still <em>look</em> like random junk, although the rising amount of computation taking place (as measured both by the average number of operations per interaction and the density of instructions per tape) suggests that <em>something</em> is afoot.</p><p>Tracking the provenance of every byte in the soup, starting from random initialization, can make sense of the apparent chaos. At first, almost every byte of every tape remains whatever it was at initialization time; if we draw a line from each byte’s current position on a tape to its original source position, the lines will all extend back to time zero in parallel, like the warp threads of a loom. Once in a while, a byte will change, cutting a thread, or get copied, pulling it across the other threads diagonally.</p><p>With the rise of scrappy replicating programs, all remaining dependencies on the past are quickly cut as replicators copy over each other in a frenzy of creative destruction. Any given byte might get copied hundreds of times to a series of different tape locations, in the process wiping out whatever had been there before. Shortly afterward, all of those copies might get wiped out in turn by some other more efficiently replicating fragment. Soon, every byte’s history becomes very brief in time, yet complex in space—a short-lived snarl of sideways jumps. The loom becomes all weft, and no warp.</p><p>Are these scrappy replicators competing or cooperating? Both. Replicators that can’t keep up are wiped out, along with any non-replicating bytes. Surviving replicators, on the other hand, continually form chimeras,<span id="ft-36" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">36</sup> </span>recombining with <em>other</em> replicators (or even copies of themselves) to become more effective still. These are, once more, symbiogenetic events: sub-entities merging to form a larger, more capable super-entity.</p><p>This chaotic phase is such a potent crucible for directed evolution that it generally doesn’t last long. It rapidly produces a robust whole-tape replicator, which then takes off exponentially, resulting in the dramatic transition to organized structure (and large amounts of computation) that are bff’s most obvious feature. This is when artificial life <em>seems</em> to spontaneously emerge.</p><p>But as we can now appreciate, there’s nothing spontaneous about it. Replicators had been there all along, and each larger replicator is composed of smaller ones—an inverted tree of life, consisting of mergers over time rather than splits.</p></div><div class="figure image undefined" id="catscradlevideo-fig"><figure class="" id="catscradlevideo-img"><img src="/assets/images//undefined" alt="" title="" id="undefined"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text-img catscradlevideo-text"></div></div><p></p><p>However, evolution’s creative work is not done yet. After the takeoff of a fully functional tape replicator, we often see yet further symbiotic events. From a classical Darwinian standpoint, this seems puzzling, since there should be no reason for further evolution to take place once whole tapes are replicating reliably. How could “fitness” possibly improve further, once a tape copies itself in its entirety every time it interacts with another tape?</p><p>We must consider that since the instructions for whole-tape replication don’t occupy all 64 bytes, there’s extra space on the tape that could be dedicated to … anything. That’s the point of von Neumann–style replication—it allows for open-ended evolution precisely because the tape can contain additional information, beyond the code needed for replication itself.<span id="ft-37" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">37</sup></span></p><p>Any extra replicated bytes could, of course, be random—just passive, purposeless information cargo hitchhiking from one generation to the next. But if these bytes contain instructions, those instructions can run. And if they can run, they can replicate <em>themselves</em>, too. Thus, the symbiogenetic process can continue to operate, creating additional replicators <em>within</em> an already replicating tape. Sometimes these sub-replicators even produce multiple copies of themselves in a single interaction.</p><p>Sub-replicators can interact with their host in many ways. They can “kill” the host by damaging <em>its</em> replication code, which is generally catastrophic for the sub-replicator, as it thereby destroys the environment within which it can run. Sub-replicators can be neutral, leaving the host’s replication machinery alone. Or, they can be symbiotic, for instance by conferring resistance to mutational damage via redundant copying of the host’s code. The overall tendency is toward symbiosis, since that is the most dynamically stable.</p><p>Over time, code colonizes a large proportion of the 64 bytes. Code is more dynamically stable than non-code, and its dynamic stability increases through symbiosis with yet more code—in particular, when code fragments find ways to work in functional tandem.</p><p>In a way, symbiosis is the very essence of functionality. When we talk about a kidney’s function only making sense <em>in context</em>, we mean that it is in symbiosis with other functions—like those of the liver (breaking ammonia down into urea), the heart (pumping blood), and so on. Each of these functions is <em>purposive</em> precisely because its inputs are the outputs of others, its outputs are inputs to others, and thus they form a network of dynamically stable cycles.</p><p>The same is true of larger, planetary-scale interrelationships. The “purpose” of plants, from the perspective of animal life, is to produce oxygen and sugar, which we breathe and eat. The “purpose” of animals, from a plant’s perspective, is to turn the oxygen back into carbon dioxide, and provide compost and pollination. Our growing understanding of life as a self-reinforcing dynamical process boils down not to <em>things</em>, but to networks of mutually beneficial <em>relationships</em>. At every scale, life is an ecology of functions.</p><p>Because functions can be expressed computationally, we could also say that life is code, and code is life. Individual computational instructions are the irreducible quanta of life—the minimal replicating set of entities, however immaterial and abstract they may seem, that come together to form bigger, more stable, and more complex replicators, in ever-ascending symbiotic cascades.</p><p>In the toy universe of bff, the elementary instructions are the seven special characters “&lt;&gt;+−,[]”. On the primordial sea floor, geothermally-driven chemical reactions that could catalyze further chemical reactions likely played the same role. Under other conditions, on another planet, or in another universe, many different elementary interactions could do the same—as long as they are Turing complete, enabling them to make the leap from autocatalytic sets to true replication.</p><p></p></div><p></p><div id="virality" class="chapter"><div class="chapter-opener"><h2>Virality</h2><p><strong>Although bff is only a toy universe, it can serve as a simplified model for life and evolution, just as a Newtonian billiard-ball universe can serve as a simplified model for the thermodynamics of ideal gases.</strong></p><p></p></div><p></p><p>As we’ve seen, some of bff’s predictions are quite different from those of classical Darwinian theory:</p><ol><li>Bff suggests that symbiogenesis is a more important driver of evolutionary innovation than random mutation.</li><li>Since symbiogenesis must involve combinations of pre-existing dynamically stable entities, we should expect complex replicating entities to emerge after (and be made of) simpler ones.</li><li>As a result, zooming in on sub-replicators within a larger replicator should allow us to peer back in evolutionary time.<span id="ft-38" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">38</sup></span></li></ol><p>These phenomena should sound familiar!

HIV specifically targets immune cells, but if a retrovirus infects an egg or sperm cell, it can insert its code into an organism’s germ line, becoming a permanent part not only of that cell, but of an entire species.

There’s mounting evidence that the relationship between virus and host can go even further, to become symbiotic.

Nearly half of our genome consists of transposable elements of one kind or another. Some were probably once retroviruses, or vice versa.

Some are new and can still cause disease; others are older and may have lost the ability to make viral envelopes or the other machinery needed to become infectious; and yet others have integrated themselves so deeply into our own code that they are no longer distinct. Some of this code is even serving critical functions in our bodies. It’s obvious that, at least by this last stage of the process, complete symbiosis has been established: neither the host nor the sub-replicator could survive, let alone reproduce, on its own.</p><p>In his 2009 book <em>Virolution</em>,<span id="ft-44" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">44</sup> </span>author and physician Frank Ryan goes further, arguing that viruses may have been symbionts all along. Plague viruses like HIV don’t come from nowhere; they are species jumpers. We know that HIV was originally SIV, the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, variants of which are endemic to Old World primates including African green monkeys, sooty mangabeys, mandrills, and chimpanzees. Yet many of these viruses don’t sicken their original hosts.<span id="ft-45" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">45</sup></span></p><p>We also know that if a virus finds itself inside an organism whose physiology is <em>too</em> different from that of its original host, it can’t gain purchase—a lucky thing for you, if you’ve ever swallowed a mouthful of seawater, which likely contained about a billion virus particles! (Most would have targeted single-celled marine life.) The greatest danger seems to come from viruses adapted to a different but closely related species. Perhaps, when it kills, such a virus is doing its job: wiping out rivals who have invaded the original host’s territory.</p><p>Viruses could, in other words, work like an out-of-body immune system. Within our bodies, our immune systems seek out and destroy cells that are recognized as “not-us.” Outside our bodies, “our” viruses could be similarly seeking out and destroying whole animals who are recognized as “not-us.” Once a virus becomes endemic to a new population, though—even if it initially kills many—it will differentiate, co-adapt, and perhaps eventually go native.</p><p>One could consider bacterial pathogens through a similar lens; hence the well-documented plagues of smallpox that European colonists brought to the Americas, decimating Native populations, and the virulent (though less deadly) syphilis epidemic believed to have been brought back to Europe by Columbus.<span id="ft-46" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">46</sup> </span>Unlike bacteria, though, retroviruses don’t just take up residence in our environment or in our bodies, but fuse into our very genomes, becoming inextricably part of us—especially when they alter the germ line.</p><p>By sheer volume, our DNA appears to be made primarily of the layered remnants of many such past fusions.

Unlike point mutation, a chunk of code that has already circulated, jumping around in the genome or even between species, isn’t random. It necessarily includes real functionality.

In the aftermath of World War II, Richardson, a Quaker, had been trying to build a mathematical model to predict the likelihood of conflicts between countries. One of the parameters in his model was the length of their common border. He was perplexed to find, though, that certain borders didn’t appear to have agreed-upon lengths. The Portuguese, for instance, reported that their border with Spain was 613 miles long, but the Spanish claimed that it was 754 miles long. This seemed like a weirdly large discrepancy for what ought to have been an easily surveyed distance\!<p>Richardson eventually figured out what was going on: the Spanish were using a higher-resolution map. Every twist and turn the Portuguese could see in the Minho, Douro, and Guadiana rivers separating the countries had finer-scale twists and turns only visible on the Spanish map. Richardson showed that, if zooming in on any given meandering revealed more meanderings, the total length of a “self-similar” curve like a coastline or a river can grow without limit as one measures it with an ever-smaller ruler.<span id="ft-50" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">50</sup></span></p></div><div class="figure image undefined" id="britain-fig"><figure class="" id="britain-img"><img src="/assets/images//undefined" alt="" title="" id="undefined"><figcaption>[DONE]</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text-img britain-text"></div></div><p></p><div class="img-wrapper figarea" id="mandelcurve"><div class="text-img mandelcurve-text">“Fractal geometry” is thus very different from the Euclidean geometry we all learned in school, where the length of a line or curve is well-defined and doesn’t blow up when you zoom in.

In structures like these, fractal geometry over some range of scales offers an elegant design solution to a biophysical problem. For instance, blood carrying oxygen and nutrients needs to reach every cell in the body, which means that oxygenated blood has to be pumped through a branching network of tubes, and these tubes—which are, in Euclidean terms, one-dimensional—have to repeatedly subdivide to “fill” three-dimensional space. Hence, we have fractally branching (and then merging) networks of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins.<p>By working out the design properties of such fractal networks and their implications, theoretical physicist Geoffrey West and his collaborators at the Santa Fe Institute have figured out many fundamental “scaling laws” in biology.<span id="ft-51" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">51</sup> </span>One of the most well-known results from this body of work explains why every mammalian heart will beat about 1.5−2 billion times over a lifetime, whether it belongs to an Etruscan shrew (weighing a twentieth of an ounce, and living a year or so), or a blue whale (weighing over 300,000 pounds, and living about a century).</p><p>Self-similarity in general yields “power law” scaling relationships, which look like straight lines when plotted on logarithmic axes.<span id="ft-52" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">52</sup> </span>Body mass, for instance, has power-law relationships with metabolic rate, the total length of the circulatory system, and lifespan.<span id="ft-53" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">53</sup> </span>Combining various power-law relationships to calculate the number of heartbeats in a lifetime causes all the scaling variables to cancel out beautifully, yielding the famous 1.5−2 billion beat constant.

How, then, would one go about quantifying this multifractal-like property in a genome?</p><p>The answer is closely related to data compression. Consider bff. In its initial state, the tapes consist of random bytes; no repetitive structure exists. If we were reading through the tapes one byte at a time, the next byte would have an equal probability of assuming any value, from 0 to 255, independent of any of the previous bytes. Therefore, the sequence is entirely unpredictable, which means that if you were to try compressing the soup with file compression software, like ZIP, the compressor wouldn’t be able to squeeze the file size at all. (This is, harkening back to thermodynamics, a working definition of a completely disordered state.)</p><p>Data are redundant—that is, compressible—precisely to the degree that they are predictable, or, equivalently, exhibit order. Compression algorithms like those in ZIP work by looking for patterns in the data stream so far and exploiting those patterns to encode subsequent data using as few bits as possible. The usual trick is to incrementally build a dictionary or “phrase book” out of the source material, and to substitute sections of the text for pointers into this dictionary whenever the pointer can be encoded in fewer bits than the original text. The dictionary is, in effect, a predictive model, and since the compressor builds that model incrementally as it compresses, the decompressor is able to incrementally reconstruct an identical copy of the model as it <em>de</em>compresses.</p><p>Absent any prior knowledge about how to model a long sequence, describing it in terms of previously encountered parts of itself is a good strategy. The full text of this book ZIPs down to about 35% of its original size as a raw text string, since some letters occur more often than others, there are a lot of repeated words, and those words often combine into stock phrases.<span id="ft-57" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">57</sup></span></p><p>When bff undergoes its sharp transition to whole-tape replication, the tapes suddenly become highly compressible; they squeeze down to just 5% of their original size. Interestingly, many regions of the human genome are highly compressible too. The reason these data streams compress so well is that, at any given point in the sequence, one can often make a pretty good guess as to what the next letter will be, simply by looking for the longest previous sequence that matches the current context.</p><p>Such matches arise due to replication. In the human genome, we’re not talking about replication at the level of the individual, but, rather, at the level of transposable elements (or their fossil remnants) <em>within</em> our genome. Similarly, even a <em>single</em> bff tape is highly compressible, because it formed through a symbiotic fusion of smaller replicators … and these replicators are themselves likely to be either copies of each other or related, having formed out of yet smaller imperfect replicators … which are themselves either copies or related.</p><p>Like fractals, sequences of symbols constructed by repeatedly copying sub-sequences of all lengths exhibit power-law scaling—in this case, between the lengths of repeated sequences and their frequency. For instance, a replicated sequence twice the length of another might be found half as often—which is pretty often! (These statistics would be dramatically different for random sequences, where increasing the sequence length would cause a much faster <em>exponential</em> decline in expected frequency.<span id="ft-58" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">58</sup> </span>) Sequences constructed according to a fixed self-copying rule are, in a sense, infinitely compressible, for they contain only as much information as it would take to write down the recipe, no matter how long the sequence.</p><p>By contrast, in a complex replicating system like bff—let alone the genome—the <em>way</em> any particular set of replicating sub-sequences combine to form a larger replicating sequence will always be specific. It will depend on the functional particulars of how those parts come together to make a working whole. Therefore there is novelty, or information, in each such combination. However, that information will be much less than would be needed to specify an arbitrary symbol sequence of the same length.</p><p>When we look for this property in bff and in human genome data, that’s just what we find! Not only do both compress very well; they also compress better and better the longer the stream of data gets. For instance, a single bff tape compresses somewhat, but the whole soup compresses better, and as the size of the soup grows, the compression ratio continues to improve—though no matter how much has already been seen, the remainder is never fully predictable.</p><p>Similarly, while a single stretch of a human genome already compresses well, the whole genome compresses better. If you compress it in the statistical context of many other human genomes, so much of the information becomes redundant that a compressed version of <em>your</em> genome would be small enough to send as an email attachment.<span id="ft-59" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">59</sup> </span>The pattern continues if we zoom yet farther out to consider genomes across species. Hence the famous statistic that the human genome is 98% identical to the chimpanzee genome … and 60% similar to that of the fruit fly!</p><p>While common ancestry alone can explain many of the similarities across species (though not all, as BovB illustrates), such classical Darwinian arguments can’t explain why the genome of a single individual is also so repetitive. That only makes sense when we begin to consider genomes to be <em>made out of</em> smaller genomes.</p><p>DNA and bff tapes, in other words, are both systems that evolve through what we could call “multifractal symbiosis.” Our genomes are aggregates of cooperating replicators, all the way down. That’s why they are so compressible. But it’s also why wonderful new kinds of complexity emerge at every scale—and therefore why, in biology, we can always learn something new by zooming in or out.</p><p></p></div><p></p><div id="embodiment" class="chapter"><div class="chapter-opener"><h2>Embodiment</h2><p><strong>There’s a profound yet subtle relationship between the multifractal properties of our bodies and the multifractal properties of the genome.</strong></p><p>The relationship is subtle because the genetic code is by no means a one-to-one blueprint explicitly representing the body’s final shape.

The universal constructor is the engine not only of reproduction, but also of growth, development, healing, and maintenance. It created your circulatory system and skin during embryonic development; it also heals your skin and replaces the torn capillaries underneath when you get a cut. As long as you are alive, your body will be continuously constructing and reconstructing itself. The code never stops running.<p>And since a universal constructor is a kind of Universal Turing Machine, its computations, or equivalently mathematical functions, are inherently “compositional”: complex functions (or programs) can be made out of sub-functions, which can in turn be made out of sub-sub functions … until, at bottom, everything could be expressed in terms of the elementary instructions of a Turing machine.</p></div><div class="figure image undefined" id="antp-fig"><figure class="" id="antp-img"><img src="/assets/images/chapter-11/61484_flyheadverto-Enhanced-SR EDIT.webp" alt="" title="" id="61484_flyheadverto-Enhanced-SR EDIT.webp"><figcaption>A mutation in the <i>Antennapedia</i> (or <i>“Antp”</i>) Hox gene of the fruit fly causes an extra pair of legs to grow out of the head in place of antennae, illustrating compositionality in body construction. <i>Top</i>: wildtype; <i>Bottom</i>: mutant.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text-img antp-text"></div></div><p></p><div class="img-wrapper figarea" id="nautilus"><div class="text-img nautilus-text">Functions can even be made out of *themselves*.

The blood vessel branching code <em>must</em> get reused. And with relatively minor tweaks, it must be possible for the parameters of that code to be adjusted so that the branching stops at the appropriate size for a shrew, or goes on to construct something the size of a blue whale, since shrews and whales are, in the grand scheme of things, close relatives.</p><p>From an evolutionary perspective, compositionality implies a hierarchical network of symbiotic relationships. The bacteria that became mitochondria and the archaea that engulfed them each started with the code necessary to reproduce themselves. When they merged into a eukaryote, they still needed to retain the instructions for their own reproduction, but they also needed to evolve additional functionality for mutual regulation. When eukaryotes became multicellular, the same needed to happen again; our cells still know how to reproduce individually, and, indeed, cellular reproduction is a fundamental operation involved in the larger-scale growth and reproduction of a whole animal.</p><p>What is true of evolution is also true of development.<span id="ft-60" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">60</sup> </span>Blood vessels, for instance, aren’t just Euclidean line segments, but tubes made of layers of smooth muscle cells.

We could ask an even more jarring question: are computers, whether they’re running AI or not, <em>alive</em>?<span id="ft-61" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">61</sup></span></p></div><p></p><p>They are certainly purposive, or we couldn’t talk about them being broken or buggy. But hardware and software are, in general, unable to reproduce, grow, heal, or evolve on their own, because engineers learned long ago that self-modifying code (like bff, or DNA) is hard to understand and debug.<span id="ft-62" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">62</sup> </span>Thus, phones don’t make baby phones. Apps don’t write new versions of themselves.</p><p>And yet: there are more phones in the world this year than last year; apps acquire new features, become obsolete, and eventually reach end-of-life, replaced by new ones; and AI models are improving from month to month. Electronic components and computer code also exhibit the same kind of compositionality we’ve seen in bff and DNA. It certainly <em>looks</em> as if technology is reproducing and evolving! Debating its aliveness is thus a bit like the debate over whether viruses (which also can’t reproduce on their own) are alive.</p><p>If we zoom out, though, putting technology and humans in the frame together, we can see that this larger, symbiotic “us” is certainly reproducing, growing, and evolving. The emergence of technology, and the mutually beneficial—if sometimes fraught—relationship between people and tech is nothing more or less than our own most recent major evolutionary transition. Technology, then, is not distinct from nature or biology, but merely its most recent evolutionary layer.</p><p>And what about that age-old inanimate stuff—rocks and rivers, mountains and beaches, clouds and storms? Water molecules in themselves are clearly not capable of general computation, and yet, in the context of the hydrologic cycle, clouds, rainstorms, and rivers certainly serve critical ecological functions, and are profoundly shaped by life. Likewise, our planet’s metal and sand get shaped into steam engines and computer chips. All of these are part of that grand network of interdependency we call Earth. Why do we draw boundaries around certain networks of functions and insist that they are “alive,” while the surrounding functions are not?</p><p>This way lies vitalism, a view espoused in various forms by a long line of philosophers from Posidonius of Apameia (circa 135–51 BCE, and undoubtedly reflecting a much older tradition) to Henri Bergson (1859–1941). Some modern thinkers, too, defend the vitalist position, such as Jane Bennett:</p><p>“The quarantines of matter and life encourage us to ignore the vitality of matter and the lively powers <em>of</em> material formations […]. By ‘vitality’ I mean the capacity of things—edibles, commodities, storms, metals—not only to impede or block the will and designs of humans but also to act as quasi agents or forces with trajectories […] or tendencies of their own. [… Our] analyses of political events might change if we gave the force of things more due.”<span id="ft-63" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">63</sup></span></p><p>We resist such ideas because we tend to reserve the notion of agency only for ourselves. The idea of agency in a molecule or a storm, let alone an abstraction like money, seems especially far-fetched. We also tend to think in terms of a hierarchy in which “we” (for whatever value of “we”) are at the top, and agency must surely diminish for anything “lower”—a view reminiscent of the medieval Great Chain of Being. When we (hesitantly) extend “agency” to the nonhuman, we tend to do so only for things that act obviously, individually, and on fast timescales, rather than in the aggregate and on slower, more evolutionary ones. It might be time to re-examine these ideas more holistically.</p><p>My purpose here is not to follow in Bennett’s footsteps—though I do find her project worth taking seriously. Language is, necessarily, imprecise, no matter what definitions we pick. This doesn’t mean that words are useless, though. When our language can become more rigorous and scientifically grounded, and when we use it to describe patterns across a wide range of phenomena, we can start to see through ideological thickets.</p><p>I hope I have explained both clearly and rigorously how the phenomena that give rise to the complexifying dynamics of life apply much more broadly than to the entities we normally think of as “alive” or “agential.” Accordingly, we could expand our definitions of these existing words, or adopt new ones, or do a bit of each. Personally, I would find some broadening of the old everyday words helpful.</p><p>That would hardly break new ground. Many traditional, nominally “prescientific” worldviews embrace notions of aliveness, agency, and even personhood that are far broader than the modern Western ones. This seems a likely case of convergent evolution in languages and ideas, motivated by the common need among traditional societies to take symbiosis seriously to secure their own survival, and to flourish. It’s practical as much as it is spiritual: encouraging richer modeling of agency in “nature” enhances a society’s dynamic stability, since all things in “nature,” ourselves included, are so mutually interdependent.</p><p>Thus it can be useful to take the view of an animal, plant, or river at times, even if they can’t take ours, the better to care for them—and for ourselves. That, ultimately, is the best reason to consider adopting, or at least adapting, a more inclusive view of the animate. Potawatomi writer and biologist Robin Wall Kimmerer makes this case eloquently in her book <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em>.<span id="ft-64" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">64</sup></span></p><div class="img-wrapper figarea" id="uluru"><div class="text-img uluru-text">In agreeing with Kimmerer, I am not encouraging superstition. When scientists castigate animist beliefs as superstitious, they typically appeal to the materialist discoveries of the Enlightenment, which show that the atoms that make up our bodies are no different from the atoms that make up rocks or air. This is true. Atoms are atoms; they all obey the same rules. Hence, the Enlightenment model of a clockwork universe, governed by dynamical laws.<p>Yet as Schrödinger pointed out in 1944, our understanding of these laws—which he played such a central role in developing—remains incomplete. The laws as they stand do not account for the complex, dynamically stable, symbiotic phenomena that comprise so much of our experience on Earth—indeed, without which there would be no such thing as experience at all. There would be no life, or purpose, or minds, or agency.</p><p>As we both embrace scientific rigor <em>and</em> start to figure out those “‘other laws of physics’ hitherto unknown,”<span id="ft-65" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">65</sup> </span>we should perhaps be less surprised to find the shoe on the other foot. What the poet Dylan Thomas called “the force that through the green fuse drives the flower”<span id="ft-66" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">66</sup> </span>drives all atoms, not just the ones we presume to be alive.</p></div><div class="figure image undefined" id="uluru-fig"><figure class="" id="uluru-img"><img src="/assets/images/chapter-12/Uluru-Kata_Tjuta_National_Park-_aboriginal_drawings.webp" alt="" title="" id="Uluru-Kata_Tjuta_National_Park-_aboriginal_drawings.webp"><figcaption>Aṉaŋu rock art, Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park, Australia</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text-img uluru-text"></div></div><p></p><p></p></div><p></p><div id="acknowledgments" class="chapter"><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>Although this is a small book, it (appropriately enough) nestles into a tangled heterarchy of larger projects, owing its existence to a great many people and several institutions—especially Google, Antikythera, the Berggruen Institute, the Santa Fe Institute, the Mila-Quebec AI Institute, and MIT Press. Many of the people I’ll thank below are affiliated with more than one of these.</p><p>As a designed object, this book’s co-creator is James Goggin of Practise, in Auckland. Our third collaboration, <em>What Is Life?</em> further develops an approach to simultaneously physical and digitally native media we’ve established with our first two projects, <em>Ubi Sunt</em> and <em>Who Are We Now?</em> (both published by Hat &amp; Beard Press, with warm thanks to JC Gabel).</p><p>Clea Agüera-Arcas, Loraine Agüera-Arcas, and Johan Michalove have helped research, edited painstakingly, offered line-by-line critique, chased down sources and permissions, coded workflows, wrangled spreadsheets, and in short dedicated an immense effort over many months to making the book as beautiful, readable, fair, and accurate as we could. Brian Sholis did the final editing and proofreading. However, I take sole responsibility for any remaining errors or omissions, and all opinions, mistaken or not, are my own.</p><p>In collaboration with James Goggin, Minkyoung Kim and Marie Otsuka designed and implemented the web version, which includes a good deal of video and interactive content. The simulations owe a heavy debt to Alex Mordvintsev (also the inventor of neural cellular automata), and his elegant SwissGL library.</p><p>Close readings of the text and detailed editorial input, which improved the final result significantly, came from Benjamin Bratton, Stephanie Sherman, Adrienne Fairhall, Anselm Agüera y Arcas, Eliot Agüera y Arcas, David LeBrun, Ben Laurie, Luca Versari, David Wolpert, and Emily French. Warm thanks also to Patricia Churchland, Walter Fontana, N. Katherine Hayles, Reid Hoffman, Michael Levin, Johan Liedgren, Charles Mudede, Addy Pross, Carl Schoonover, Terry Sejnowski, Justin Smith-Ruiu, Dan Sperber, Korina Stark, John Thornhill, Sara Walker, and Ren Weschler. Thank you, Margaret Levi and Bob Kaplan, for connecting me with Papunya Tula Artists in Australia’s Western Desert, and thank you, Spike Mafford, for the beautiful photography. Yalti Napangati’s artwork, which envelopes this book, is the most eloquent expression of symbiogenesis.</p><p>At Google, I owe deep thanks to James Manyika and Sundar Pichai for giving my team, Paradigms of Intelligence (PI), the freedom and resources to pursue interdisciplinary basic research. I’m grateful to Demis Hassabis and Yossi Matias for their support of internal collaboration with Google DeepMind and Google Research, respectively, and to Yul Kwon for his deft co-leadership of PI.

Visiting faculty James Evans, Guillaume Lajoie, and Blake Richards have been wonderful friends and colleagues, and have all made intellectual contributions to the material presented here.</p><p>Time spent at the Santa Fe Institute over the past two years has profoundly influenced my perspective on life, complexity, and intelligence. I have also met a number of new collaborators, fellow travelers, and constructive critics (often a bit of each) there, including Kevin Berger, Sean Carroll, David Chalmers, Ted Chiang, Michael Hersch, Chris Kempes, David Krakauer, John Krakauer, Gary Lupyan, Brice Ménard, Melanie Mitchell, Carlo Rovelli, Zenna Tavares, Geoffrey West, and David Wolpert.</p><p><em>What Is Life?</em> and its mothership <em>What Is Intelligence?</em> are among the first long-form publications of the Antikythera program, under the direction of Benjamin Bratton. Benjamin has instigated many of my major writing projects in recent years, including these books, and has been a loyal friend and frequent collaborator. Warm thanks also to Haley Albert, Nicolay Boyadjiev, Nils Gilman, Emily Knapp, Dawn Nakagawa, Estela Oliva, Tobias Rees, and Claire Webb; my gratitude, also, to Nicolas Berggruen for his intellectual friendship and support, and to the Berggruen Institute.</p><p>Finally, warm thanks to Noah Springer of MIT Press, for believing in this project and for helping us bend the rules of traditional academic publishing.</p><p></p></div><p></p><div id="about-the-author" class="chapter"><h1>About the author</h1><p>Blaise Agüera y Arcas is a VP and Fellow at Google, where he is the CTO of Technology &amp; Society and founder of Paradigms of Intelligence (PI).

She is one of the “Pintupi Nine,” a traditional family who remained unaware of European colonization until 1984, when they made contact with relatives near Kiwirkurra. This painting depicts designs associated with the rockhole and soakage water site of Marrapinti, west of Kiwirrkurra. During ancestral times a large group of women gathered at this site during their travels toward the east. While at the site the women made nose bones, also known as marrapinti, which are worn through a hole made in the nasal septum. These nose bones were originally used by both men and women but are now only inserted by the older generation on ceremonial occasions. Upon completion of the ceremonies at Marrapinti the women continued their travels east to Ngaminya and then onto Wilkinkarra (Lake Mackay). The shapes in the painting represent geographical features of the landscape and bush foods the women collected as they traveled.</p><p></p></div><p></p><div id="note-on-the-type" class="chapter"><h1>Note on the type</h1><p>This book, both print and web editions, is typeset in Exposure, a variable typeface designed between 2019 and 2022 by Federico Parra Barrios at the Atelier National de Recherche Typographique in Nancy, France.
