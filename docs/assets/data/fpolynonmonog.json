\"AgeCat\", for plotting weighted binomial distributions\nas a function of the respondent's age.\n\nThe data are specified in such a way that dynamic rebinning by age is\nsupported, as well as either weighted or unweighted plotting or analysis.\nThe weights are calculated using stratified sampling based on demographic\ncriteria, as explained in the appendix https://whoarewenow.net/appendix.\n\nJSON entries with example values:\n\nKey        Value                 Comment\n--------   --------------------
