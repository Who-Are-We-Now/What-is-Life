               feast' Nassim Nicholas TalebFor generations, our remote
               ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike - either
               free and equal, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are
               told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original
               freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David
               Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged
               in the eighteenth century as a reaction to indigenous critiques
               of European society, and why they are wrong. In doing so, they
               overturn our view of human history, including the origins of
               farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery and civilization
               itself.Drawing on path-breaking research in archaeology and
               anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more
               interesting place once we begin to see what's really there. If
               humans did not spend 95 per cent of their evolutionary past in
               tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that
               time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into
               hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic
               organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected,
               and suggest that the course of history may be less set in stone,
               and more full of playful possibilities than we tend to
               assume.The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our
               understanding of the human past and offers a path toward
               imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society.

  abstract = "Prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) produce an alarm call when a predator
              appears. Gunnison's prairie dogs (Cynomys gunnisoni) produce
              calls that vary in spectral structure according to predator type
              and specific characteristics unique to the individual predator,
              such as color and shape. These calls vary depending on geographic
              location and have been characterized as dialects. Black-tailed
              prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) also encode information about
              terrestrial predators in their alarm calls. However, nothing is
              known about whether there are dialects in these alarm calls, and
              if so, why these dialects might have arisen. We studied the alarm
              calls and habitat characteristics of eight different black-tailed
              prairie dog colonies within the Southwestern USA: Maxwell
              National Wildlife Refuge, NM, Vermejo Park Ranch, NM, Kiowa
              National Grasslands, NM, Rita Blanca National Grasslands, TX, and
              Comanche National Grasslands, CO. An analysis of time and
              frequency changes in alarm calls showed that colony sites that
              were located within 30 km each other did not have significant
              differences in alarm call structure, but sites that were more
              distant were significantly different from the other sites,
              consistent with the existence of dialects as well as with genetic
              models of isolation by distance. The acoustic structure of the
              alarm calls was not explained by differences in habitat
              characteristics at each site. A comparison of Squared Euclidian
              Distances (D2) of alarm calls versus linear distances between
              sites showed a significant positive correlation, implying that
              alarm call dialect differences increase the farther one site is
              from another. This relationship is consistent with a cultural
              diffusion model of dialects, and is similar to that observed in
              human dialects.",

  abstract = "Human societies are examined as distinct and coherent groups.
              This trait is most parsimoniously considered a deeply rooted part
              of our ancestry rather than a recent cultural invention. Our
              species is the only vertebrate with society memberships of
              significantly more than 200. We accomplish this by using
              society-specific labels to identify members, in what I call an
              anonymous society. I propose that the human brain has evolved to
              permit not only the close relationships described by the social
              brain hypothesis, but also, at little mental cost, the anonymous
              societies within which such alliances are built. The human
              compulsion to discover or invent labels to ``mark'' group
              memberships may originally have been expressed in hominins as
              vocally learned greetings only slightly different in function
              from chimpanzee pant hoots (now known to be society-specific).
              The weight of evidence suggests that at some point, conceivably
              early in the hominin line, the distinct groups composed of
              several bands that were typical of our ancestors came to be
              distinguished by their members on the basis of multiple labels
              that were socially acquired in this way, the earliest of which
              would leave no trace in the archaeological record. Often
              overlooked as research subjects, these sizable fission-fusion
              communities, in recent egalitarian hunter-gatherers sometimes
              2,000 strong, should consistently be accorded the status of
              societies, in the same sense that this word is used to describe
              tribes, chiefdoms, and other cultures arising later in our
              history. The capacity of hunter-gatherer societies to grow
              sufficiently populous that not all members necessarily recognize
              one another would make the transition to larger agricultural
              societies straightforward. Humans differ from chimpanzees in that
              societal labels are essential to the maintenance of societies and
              the processes giving birth to new ones. I propose that anonymous
              societies of all kinds can expand only so far as their labels can
              remain sufficiently stable.",

  author    = "Edelman, Lee",
  abstract  = "In this searing polemic, Lee Edelman outlines a radically
               uncompromising new ethics of queer theory. His main target is
               the all-pervasive figure of the child, which he reads as the
               linchpin of our universal politics of ``reproductive futurism.''
               Edelman argues that the child, understood as innocence in need
               of protection, represents the possibility of the future against
               which the queer is positioned as the embodiment of a
               relentlessly narcissistic, antisocial, and future-negating
               drive. He boldly insists that the efficacy of queerness lies in
               its very willingness to embrace this refusal of the social and
               political order. In No Future, Edelman urges queers to abandon
               the stance of accommodation and accede to their status as
               figures for the force of a negativity that he links with irony,
               jouissance, and, ultimately, the death drive itself.Closely
               engaging with literary texts, Edelman makes a compelling case
               for imagining Scrooge without Tiny Tim and Silas Marner without
               little Eppie. Looking to Alfred Hitchcock's films, he embraces
               two of the director's most notorious creations: the sadistic
               Leonard of North by Northwest, who steps on the hand that holds
               the couple precariously above the abyss, and the terrifying
               title figures of The Birds, with their predilection for
               children. Edelman enlarges the reach of contemporary
               psychoanalytic theory as he brings it to bear not only on works
               of literature and film but also on such current political
               flashpoints as gay marriage and gay parenting. Throwing down the
               theoretical gauntlet, No Future reimagines queerness with a
               passion certain to spark an equally impassioned debate among its
               readers.",

               Since the early 1900s, most studies on animal-human
               communication have focused on great apes and a few cetacean
               species. Birds were rarely used in similar studies on the
               grounds that they were merely talented mimics--that they were,
               after all, ``birdbrains.'' Experiments performed primarily on
               pigeons in Skinner boxes demonstrated capacities inferior to
               those of mammals; these results were thought to reflect the
               capacities of all birds, despite evidence suggesting that
               species such as jays, crows, and parrots might be capable of
               more impressive cognitive feats. Twenty years ago Irene
               Pepperberg set out to discover whether the results of the pigeon
               studies necessarily meant that other birds--particularly the
               large-brained, highly social parrots--were incapable of
               mastering complex cognitive concepts and the rudiments of
               referential speech. Her investigation and the bird at its
               center--a male Grey parrot named Alex--have since become almost
               as well known as their primate equivalents and no less a subject
               of fierce debate in the field of animal cognition. This book
               represents the long-awaited synthesis of the studies
               constituting one of the landmark experiments in modern
